    <p className="p">My name is Jhonna Acebo, a 20-year-old third-year Computer Science student 
      at the University of Cabuyao. I am currently focused on learning Web Development, 
      exploring both front-end and back-end technologies to build dynamic and user-friendly websites. 
      Although I'm still honing my programming skills, I am passionate about creating well-designed 
      and functional web applications. I'm eager to gain more experience, work on real-world projects, 
      and continue learning and stay updated with the latest trends 
      and best practices in the field of web development.</p>
